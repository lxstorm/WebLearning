		<p>In the game, players choose one of six character classes – Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Witch Doctor or Wizard (with the Crusader being unavailable unless the player has purchased the expansion pack, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls) – and are tasked with defeating the Lord of Terror, Diablo.</p>

Diablo III received acclaim from critics, although its digital rights management that requires an internet connection at all times was criticized.[8]</p>
